# Time Driver-Navigator Pairing

The participants will take turns of 5 minutes on each role, driver and navigator.

## Roles
The **Driver** is the person at the wheel, i.e. the keyboard. She is focussed on completing the tiny goal at hand, ignoring larger issues for the moment. A driver should always talk through what she is doing while doing it.

The **Navigator** is in the observer position, while the driver is typing. She reviews the code on-the-go, gives directions and shares thoughts. The navigator also has an eye on the larger issues, bugs, and makes notes of potential next steps or obstacles.

The idea of this role division is to have two different perspectives on the code. The driver's thinking is supposed to be more tactical, thinking about the details, the lines of code at hand. The navigator can think more strategically in their observing role. They have the big picture in mind.
